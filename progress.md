# FoodLens - Development Progress

## Project Overview
FoodLens is a minimal, clean food nutrition scanner app built with React Native (Expo). Users take/upload a photo of food, AI analyzes it, and returns detailed nutrition info (calories, macros, vitamins).

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 54 (React Native 0.81.5, New Architecture enabled by default)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 7 (Native Stack)
- **State Management**: Zustand 5
- **Storage**: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage 2.2.0 (Expo Go compatible)
- **Image**: expo-image-picker ~17.0.10, expo-camera ~17.0.10
- **Icons**: @expo/vector-icons
- **Styling**: StyleSheet (inline, no external library)

## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
- [x] Install all dependencies (versions locked to Expo SDK 54 compatibility)
- [x] Set up folder structure (`src/` with components, screens, navigation, store, services, types, theme, utils)
- [x] Configure theme system (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, border radius)
- [x] Create TypeScript types (FoodItem, NutritionInfo, VitaminInfo, ScreenNames)
- [x] Set up Zustand store (appStore with history, loading, error, API key state)
- [x] Set up AsyncStorage service (save/get food history, API key)
- [x] Create reusable UI components (Button, Card, Typography)
- [x] Configure React Navigation (Stack Navigator with 4 screens)
- [x] Create placeholder screens:
  - HomeScreen - Landing page with scan/history navigation
  - ScanScreen - Camera + gallery picker with image preview
  - ResultsScreen - Nutrition display (calories, macros, vitamins)
  - HistoryScreen - Food scan history list with empty state
- [x] Configure app.json (permissions, bundle IDs, splash colors, expo-font plugin)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors
- [x] Expo doctor passes all 17 checks
- [x] App runs successfully in Expo Go

### Phase 2: Camera & Image ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Image capture with expo-camera
- [x] Image picker from gallery with expo-image-picker
- [x] Image preview and retake functionality
- [x] Image compression/optimization (0.8 quality)
- [x] Connect Scan → Results with mock data
- [x] Save to history functionality
- [x] Display scanned image in Results screen

### Phase 3: AI Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create FoodAnalysisService interface (adapter pattern)
- [x] Implement aiService.ts with provider abstraction
- [x] Implement OpenAI adapter (openaiService.ts) - Primary
- [x] Implement Gemini adapter (geminiService.ts) - Backup
- [x] Switch between providers via ACTIVE_PROVIDER config
- [x] Prompt engineering for food + nutrition extraction
- [x] Parse structured JSON response
- [x] Error handling and retry logic
- [x] Loading states during analysis
- [x] Clear button to retake photo
- [x] API key management (hardcoded for MVP)

### Phase 4: Results & Confirmation ✅ COMPLETED (mostly done in Phase 3)
- [x] Connect AI results to ResultsScreen
- [x] Save to history flow
- [x] Loading states during analysis

### Phase 5: History & Polish (PENDING)
- [ ] Connect real history data to HistoryScreen
- [ ] Loading states, error handling, empty states
- [ ] App icon and splash screen
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing on physical devices

## Key Decisions
1. **No backend for MVP** - Everything client-side, API key embedded
2. **Adapter pattern for AI** - Easy to swap between Gemini, OpenAI, Nutritionix
3. **AsyncStorage over MMKV** - MMKV requires native modules (EAS/prebuild), AsyncStorage works in Expo Go
4. **Zustand over Redux** - Minimal boilerplate, perfect for this scale
5. **Stack navigation over tabs** - Linear flow: Home → Scan → Results
6. **No newArchEnabled in app.json** - Expo Go always uses New Architecture; setting it explicitly causes conflicts

## Issues Encountered & Resolved
1. **MMKV not compatible with Expo Go** - `react-native-mmkv` uses Nitro modules which require EAS/prebuild. Switched to `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
2. **Dependency version mismatches** - Initial installs pulled v55 packages (future SDK) instead of SDK 54 compatible versions. Fixed with `npx expo install` which resolves correct versions.
3. **`newArchEnabled: false` conflict** - Expo Go always enables New Architecture; explicitly disabling it caused `expected dynamic type 'boolean', but had type 'string'` error. Removed the setting entirely.
4. **expo-image-picker mediaTypes format** - `['images']` is wrong for v17; must use `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images`.
5. **Missing expo-font peer dependency** - Required by @expo/vector-icons. Added via `npx expo install expo-font`.

## Next Steps
- User tests Phase 1
- Proceed to Phase 2 (Camera & Image) after approval
